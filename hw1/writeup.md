This was a very cool assignment. Watching the whole system come together
was a great experience, despite the amount of time it took. I appreciated the
opportunity to work with the ssh details, and had to read up on the details of
ssh in order to complete that section of the assignment. I was especially
surprised at how quickly and easily the python program worked - I had expected
it to take some time to get it right. If it wasn't 2am right now, I'd probably
develop a cooler light show with this...
